6.3 Data frames
Time series are often ordered in data frames. A data
frame is a matrix with names above the columns.
This is nice, because you can call and use one of the
columns without knowing in which position it is.
1 > t = data.frame(x = c(11,12,14),
2 y = c(19,20,21), z = c(10,9,7))
3 > t
4 x y z
5 1 11 19 10
6 2 12 20 9
7 3 14 21 7
8 > mean(t$z)
6
9 [1] 8.666667
10 > mean(t[["z"]])
11 [1] 8.666667
¡E In lines 1-2 a typical data frame called t is
constructed. Its columns have the names x, y and z.
¡E Line 8-11 show two ways of how you can select the
column called z from the data frame called t.
ToDo
Make a script file which constructs three random
normal vectors of length 100. Call these vectors x1,
x2 and x3. Make a data frame called t with three
columns (called a, b and c) containing respectively
x1, x1+x2 and x1+x2+x3. Call plot(t) for this
data frame. Can you understand the results? Rerun this script a few times.
6.4 Lists
Another basic structure in R is a list. The main advantage of lists is that the ¡§columns" (they¡¦re not
really ordered in columns any more, but are more a
collection of vectors) don¡¦t have to be of the same
length, unlike matrices and data frames.
1 > L = list(one=1, two=c(1,2),
2 five=seq(0, 1, length=5))
3 > L
4 $one
5 [1] 1
6 $two
7 [1] 1 2
8 $five
9 [1] 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00
10 > names(L)
11 [1] "one" "two" "five"
12 > L$five + 10
13 [1] 10.00 10.25 10.50 10.75 11.00
¡E Lines 1-2 construct a list with names and values.
The list also appears in the workspace window.
¡E Lines 3-9 show a typical printing (after pressing L
ENTER).
¡E Line 10 illustrates how to find out what¡¦s in the
list.
¡E Line 12 shows how to use the numbers
